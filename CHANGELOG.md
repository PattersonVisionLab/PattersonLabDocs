# 1P AOSLO Changes

- _20250417_: Permanent alignment lasers for marmoset pupil plane identification installed on pedestal posts.
- _20250411_: Put source alignment dual camera rig on a breadboard for greater stability
- _20250329_: Replaced old Melles Grillot shutter with ThorLabs SC10 and SH1
- _20250321_: Replaced long amplifier supports behind the ref and vis PMTs with a smaller baseplate
- _20250320_: Lofted PMT controller boxes on a breadboard
- _20250315_: Added Toptica/Mustang source controllers to KCH301 with adapters: now run through Kinesis software on the analysis PC
- _20250311_: New permanent marmoset model eye magnetic mount, for aligning M10 (angle is ever so slightly off from 4 degrees).
- _20250310_: Removed rack and replaced with smaller StarTech rack
- _20250210_: Motorized the reflectance source position
- _20241212_: Needed to move the final lens of the Maxwellian View back to make room for the marmoset relay. We also remounted the pellicle with an offset post adapter and a different kinematic mount (KM200BP) because the magnetic mount for the first flat in the marmoset extension was in the way. To do so, we changed the final lens from f=400 to f=500. This required moving the field stop aperture back as well to remain conjugate with the pupil plane (where the image is in focus)
- _20241209_: Completed marmoset AOSLO model eye alignment
- _20241206_: Completed marmoset AOSLO relay and closed loop
- _20241010_: New source alignment camera system (pellicle beamsplitter in a cage cube, two cameras one with a lens in front)
